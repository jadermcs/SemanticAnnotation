You will be given specific examples to learn how to accurately judge semantic changes of a word in its contexts. This initial training phase will help you understand key concepts and apply them accurately. If you do not pass this training round, you will be excluded from further tasks.\n\nYou are presented with two sentences that both contain a specific word. Your task is to analyze how this word is used in each sentence and determine if its usage in sentence 2 is more positive, negative, or neutral with respect to sentence 1. Please consider only the feeling of the word in your judgement, not the whole sentence.",

        "answer": "In sentence 1, the word 'challenge' is used with a positive connotation, while in sentence 2 it is used in association with 'daunting'. So, sentence 2 is more negative."

However, the negativity is more subtle and does not directly criticize the transition itself but its effects, making this a more complex and difficult comparison."
